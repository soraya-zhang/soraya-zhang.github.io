I have been wearing glasses since I was a kid, so I have always remembered myself having a pair of glasses on my face: my only memory of my face. The only times I can see myself not wearing glasses are those occasions when I look into the mirror while washing my face or something. But since my short-sightedness is serious, I can only see the image in the mirror clearly when I get very close to the mirror, which means I can only see a very small portion of my face in the mirror when I am not wearing my glasses. Without my glasses, I see my nose without seeing my lips, my eyes without my nose, and my lips without my eyes. I can never see the whole of my face without my pair of glasses.
